# AI-Powered Personal Finance Assistant

A Streamlit-based web application that leverages a multi-agent AI architecture to analyze personal financial transactions. Upload a CSV file containing your transaction data to gain insights, including anomaly detection, monthly spending summaries, and personalized financial advice.

## Features

- **CSV Transaction Ingestion**: Upload and process transaction data from CSV files.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identifies unusually high-value transactions for review.
- **Monthly Summaries**: Generates detailed breakdowns of monthly spending patterns.
- **Personalized Financial Advice**: Provides tailored recommendations based on spending trends and patterns.

## How It Works

The application uses a multi-agent system to process and analyze financial data:

1. **Ingestion Agent**: Parses and categorizes raw transaction data from uploaded CSV files.
2. **Anomaly Agent**: Flags transactions that are unusually large or suspicious.
3. **Summary Agent**: Aggregates data to produce monthly spending summaries.
4. **Advisor Agent**: Analyzes patterns and generates personalized financial advice.
